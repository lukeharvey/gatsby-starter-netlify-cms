We took the bus yesterday from Sigiriya to Uppuveli (a small beach town near Trincomalee) on the North East coast. It reminds us both soooo much of being on small islands in Thailand or Indonesia (the chill ones, not the party ones). It’s in an area that was affected by the war and also the tsunami so apparently it has kept it from becoming inundated with tourists. It’s very chilled out, the people are so nice and we’ve had some amazing food.

We also took the bus today to Nilaveli, an even smaller town just to the north of Uppuveli. We’re really enjoying taking the local buses. It’s squished and sweaty and nothing like public transit at home, but the locals are so nice to us and they seem very amused that we’re there :)

Today is a Poya day (every full moon is a public holiday) and we saw lots of people out in beautiful dresses and saris. It also seemed to mean that the entire local population was on the beach at Nilaveli with their families. It was pretty chaotic. A cow tried to eat a bag of fruit right out of Luke’s hand when he wasn’t looking and then wouldn’t leave us alone! All the locals (especially women) swim in all of their clothes so I decided to do the same. It’s pretty convenient actually and your clothes dry really quickly in the heat.
