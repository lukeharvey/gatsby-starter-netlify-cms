Feeling a little bit underwhelmed by Negombo, we were eager to move on to Colombo, which arguably could also be skipped, but we need to head there to extend our visas, and this can only be done in person at the Department of Immigration.

Quite pleased with our choice of hostel ([Bunkyard](http://bunkyardhostels.com/)), we dropped off our bags and headed into the centre. At Fort Station we reserved some train tickets\* to Anuradhapura on Sunday afternoon, and I then persuaded Kate to follow me into the nearby Pettah Market.

To be honest it was rather hectic and full of tat, but we explored a few of the streets and discovered a great spot for lunch. In true Asian style it didnâ€™t look like much on the outside, but it was very busy, full of locals and vegetarian, so less chance for surprises!

Kate was initially a bit skeptical about eating with her hand, and got nervous every time the waiters came round as they would keep adding something else to our banana leaves, but ultimately it was delicious, cheap and everyone, staff and other customers smiled at us throughout. We got the feeling not many tourists tend to go there!
