Soooo, a few days behind on posting because we’ve been moving around a bit. Lots of things to update you on. We’ve spent the last few days in the “cultural triangle”, an area in the centre of Sri Lanka that’s known for ancient cities, ruins and temples. In summary, it’s been beautiful but also very hot and sweaty.

We started by taking the train to Anuradhapura where we explored the ancient Sacred City on bikes. It’s a huge area, much of it covered in sort of low brick walls, which are the remains of buildings. Dotted around the area are temples called Stupa, which are domed structures that originally we thought we would be able to go inside… but it turns out you just look at them from the outside, which was also fine :)

It’s still an active place where locals come to worship or make pilgrimages to the temples. They wear all white and it was really beautiful, especially when we visited at night and they were all lighting candles and incense.

Next we travelled to Sigiriya. We made it most of the way somewhat (but not too) squished into a mini bus and then took the local bus the rest of the way. To do this we had to refuse approximately a million tuk-tuk drivers who thought it would be much better if we took a tuk-tuk the rest of the way. But anyways, we passed the test and only had to pay about 20 pence each for the bus and I feel that we are the stronger for it.

In Sigiriya we’re staying in a lovely little guest house where they feed us breakfast and dinner and it is SO GOOD! They also give us fresh juice every day when we come back from whatever adventure we were on. It’s called [http://www.booking.com/Share-ofHy7F](Sigiriya Regal Residence) and we would highly recommend.

Since being here we’ve walked up Sigiriya Rock, a massive rock formation with the ruins of a monastery or fortress at the top (apparently it’s still up for debate), hiked up Pidurangala Rock, gone on safari and seen elephants (!!), drank many fresh juices, sweated a lot and Luke has argued with several tuk-tuk drivers about their prices. See photos of most of these things below.

Tomorrow we travel to Trincomalee for some diving!
