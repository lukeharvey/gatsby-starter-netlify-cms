After a long but uneventful\* travel day we made it to our guest house in Negombo and happily fell into bed. Some time later I woke up, it was still quite dark but I also felt like maybe it was time to get up. I asked Luke what time it was, “twenty to one”. Ugghhhh.

We intentionally booked a couple nights in Negombo, which is a smallish town near the airport, to give ourselves a day to recover from jet lag. So today we just had a wander around, read our books and got our heads around our next moves. Tomorrow we head to Colombo where we plan to get a visa extension so we can stay 6 weeks in Sri Lanka instead of 4.

Some photos below from a cute cafe today. x

\*My mom likes to wish people “uneventful” travel days which means you essentially come out of it with your luggage, your passport and having not missed any flights or having to run for a plane :)
