Helloooo! Some updates for you from the last week!

We spent a few days in Ella, a town in the hill country with a kind of indie traveller vibe and really good food. We stayed in a really cute guest house with amazing breakfasts. One day we took a walk through tea plantations to Little Adam’s Peak and another day we walked to the 9 Arches Bridge. It was still hot in Ella but much cooler than the coast. It was so nice to go walking without being drenched in sweat and we had some good sleeps with the cooler nights.

We then took the train to Nuwara Eliya, part of the famous train route from Kandy to Ella. The views are stunning and we got some time in one of the doorways to look out and see the train going around the bends.

We’re now in Nuwara Eliya which has the nickname Little England. It’s another hill town and further up so quite cool here, even cold at night!\* Apparently the British colonialists felt at home here because they could have lettuce and strawberries and things. Other than the cooler temp it doesn’t remind us of England at all! Although I keep checking regularly with Luke if he’s feeling very much at home.

Nuwara Eliya is a major centre for tea production in Sri Lanka so tomorrow we are planning to tour a tea estate and hopefully do a little walk to a waterfall. The town itself is quite small so there’s not very much to do. We booked two days here and I think the timing is quite good. The day after tomorrow we head back to Ella for a night (where we left our big bags) and then head down to the south coast!

\*yes - we complain when it’s hot and also when it’s cold.
