Well, it feels like it’s been a little while since I last posted. Some of you may have seen my last post on instagram, which looked like this.

Immediately after which I came down with a really bad cold and spent the next couple days in bed. Luckily we had already planned to stay in Arugam Bay for at least 4 days and had splashed out a bit to have a nice place by the sea that’s been very comfortable ([Bay Vista](http://www.bayvistahotel.com/), highly recommend!). This was my view from bed.

I felt a bit betrayed that my body would allow me to get sick without even the chance of staying home from work for the day. I read A LOT of my book, Long Walk To Freedom by Nelson Mandela, and now I feel the South African government during apartheid was the root of all evil and I love Nelson Mandela (I’m sure this is pretty obvious and everyone else already felt this way). I also re-watched Far From the Madding Crowd and reaffirmed my love for Gabriel Oak. Luckily Luke had some work to do and enjoyed a bit of downtime while also being my caretaker.

Yesterday I felt well enough to venture out and we rented a scooter and took a little drive down the coast, eventually ending up at Peanut Farm Beach, a very chill place where we had some nice food by the beach and played in the waves while watching the surfers.

Arugam Bay is the first place we’ve been that feels a bit touristy and although it’s nice to have some more western feeling conveniences, like smoothie bowls and yoga studios, I’m really glad we started off in some of the places that felt more authentic. The people in Sri Lanka have been overwhelmingly lovely and friendly, always responding with a smile and going out of their way to be helpful. I feel a bit like the tourists who’ve come straight here might not understand that and are missing out on that interaction with the locals. Or maybe they’re not, who knows! But yes, we’ve been staying in a few guest houses and home stays and I’m glad we’ve had a mix of both.

On our way from Trincomalee to Arugam Bay we stayed for a night in Batticaloa at a homestay where we ate our dinner and breakfast the next morning in the house of the family who runs the place. We had homemade rotti and dahl while their children played on the floor and they were very happy to answer all the questions we had gathered up so far about Sri Lankan customs and food etc. The place is called [Queen’s Guest](http://www.booking.com/Share-hNipZn), it’s a bit rustic but good for one night and the experience with the family was lovely.

Tomorrow we are headed to Ella which should be a bit cooler and we plan to get in a bit of hiking!
