The most frequently asked question we’ve gotten leading up to this trip is, naturally, “Where are you going?”. So, to recap!

Sri Lanka - 6 weeks

Kerala - 4 weeks

Nepal (including 14 day Annapurna trek) - 3 weeks

Northern India - 4 weeks, or whatever time is left :)

We have all flights booked and rough itineraries in mind, along with places we definitely want to go. But in general we’re leaving things open and just booking a few days in advance of arriving somewhere. Let’s see how it goes! Bags are packed and headed to the airport in a few hours! Eek! x
