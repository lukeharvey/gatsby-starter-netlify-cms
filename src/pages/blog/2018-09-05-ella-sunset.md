![Sunset in Ella](/img/20180905_01.jpg)

Bit of a lengthy journey to Ella today. Every time we switched buses the tuk-tuk drivers tried to convince us the next bus wasn’t going to leave for ages, or it was going to be full and we would have to stand, or it was going to take soooo long to get there. Why don’t we just take a tuk-tuk instead??

We saw right through them. Obviously. Total pros.

Made it to Ella just in time to catch this view! x
