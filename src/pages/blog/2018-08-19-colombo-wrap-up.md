After 3 nights in Colombo (longer than anyone needs to stay really) we took the train today to Anuradhapura. We’ve arrived here in the evening to our little guest house and plan to tour the temples tomorrow. So in the meantime, here’s a summary on Columbo!

Most people seem to stay in Colombo for one (maaaaybe two) nights on their way into or out of the country (because it’s close to the airport) and that’s pretty much what we would recommend. Stay the night after you fly in and then move on the next day. That being said, we really liked our hostel, found some cute cafes and good food and used the time to meet other travellers and plan out a rough itinerary. Here are some things we’d recommend:

[Visa Extension](https://www.whereintheworldisnico.com/assemblage/how-to-extend-a-sri-lanka-tourist-visa) - if you’re in Colombo to extend your visa like we were, use this website, it was beyond helpful.

[Bunkyard Hostels](http://bunkyardhostels.com/) - very cute, nice common area to chill and/or meet people, staff were very nice and dorms were clean with comfy bunks. I recommend the “Dark Dorm”.

[Barefoot Garden Cafe](http://www.barefootceylon.com/cafe/) - beauuuutiful store with sri lankan textiles for home and clothing. Lovely cafe in the back.

[Old Dutch Hospital](https://lanka.com/about/attractions/old-colombo-dutch-hospital/) - pretty colonial buildings converted into restaurants, cafes and stores (a bit upscale)

[Upali’s](http://www.upalis.com/colombo/default.aspx) - yummy Sri Lankan food

[Coffee and Company](http://coffeeandcompanylk.com/) - cute cafe with coffee and fresh juices. Very tucked away.

[Sri Vihar](https://www.facebook.com/pages/biz/Sri-Vihar-1039001796142451/) - cheap and cheerful Indian food. I had the South Indian Thali and Luke had the North Indian Thali. They were both really good but I think his was better, see photo below :)
